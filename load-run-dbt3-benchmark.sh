# This script will create, load and execute a DBT3 benchmark test for Vector-H.

# This should be proportional to the size of the cluster we are running on.

# Default to 100Gb of data per node just to save a bit of time on the first test.
# Move to 1Tb per node for more realistic testing.

# Make sure that our environment is set correctly
