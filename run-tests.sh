echo By way of comparison, this test using Vector-H 4.2.1 with 1Gb of data per node, 5 concurrent users and 100 
echo queries completes in around 45 seconds on a 6 data-node, bare-metal cluster with 16 cores per node and 
echo 256Gb RAM on each node.

echo This run completed in `cat run_performance.out` of this time, where less than 100% is faster.
